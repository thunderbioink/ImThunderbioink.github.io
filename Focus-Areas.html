There, I was a bilingual Customer Service Executive dispatching, selling, and troubleshooting for different technologies provided by the company spanning from VoIP, Wireless, Networking, Cable, to general Mobile, Television, and Dish services. There, I was a high-performer that continously achieved a great relationship with the customer and company.

My work has ranged from coding audio and producing audio for gaming projects to leading global communication transition projects. I've even led a team to build a DSP and ensured proper audio broadcasting from a network standpoint. Often, I found myself in leadership roles, such as when being asked to oversee the design and development of the first Online Entry-Music College Class to be offered at BYU-Idaho during the pandemic. I also spent eight months building robots to understand the intersection of physics, mechanics, and engineering in technology. I look forward to continue improving both my soft and hard skills as I pursue future tech roles.</p> -->
