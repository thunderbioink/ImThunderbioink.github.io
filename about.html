                    <p>Thunderbioink is just a fun username I chose for my GitHub profile and overall tech presence. My real name is Alma Camarillo, born in Veracruz, MX. I am 25 years-old and on the lookout for my next destination in the USA as I navigate the excitement of finding a new job in the tech industry. I graduated this April, 2024 from the great institution of BYU-Idaho with a degree in Software Engineering. There, I discovered a passion for technology in a very unique way.</p>
                    <p>I have a heavy background in the arts, where I have been composing my own music since the age of 14, while also creating my own drawings and paintings since I was 3. I received formal training for painting and drawing from the age of 6 all the way to the age of 17. I too began singing from a young age, where my mother, my obsession for jazz and opera music, and family jam sessions were my early vocal training. I taught myself how to play the piano after few encounters with formal music training, the guitar from observing my parents and brother, and using the Internet once it became an available tool in my home.</p>
                    <p>Prior to studying at BYU-I, for almost three years, I was asked to record and interpret for Spanish-speaking Audiences a couple of Christian songs. Throughout this project, I engaged in formal Opera training technique with a well-known instructor named Eugenia Sutti. With her, I prepared my audition to attend BYU-I as a Vocal Performance Student. I got accepted and until 2019 I was set on studying Vocal Performance.</p>

                    <p>Months prior to the COVID-19 shutdown, I had a concussion that forced me into a year of re-learning how to live. As the Pandemic and my head-rest took priority, I had to stop singing, dancing, and straining my head from what used to be my only career path. This led me to pursue other possible career paths, and before giving up on BYU-I, I took my first official CIT class: Linux. My proffessor from that class, Professor Okuda, saw my potential in tech and convinced me of the possibilities of career options I could pursue. His faith in me, motivated me to switch my career path to Software Engineering. </p>
                    <p>At first, I only wanted to learn what brought Audio technology to be the way it is. Soon, my curiosity unfolded to more areas of tech, like Embedded Systems, Networking, IT Systems Adminstration, CyberSecurity essentials, Robotics, and Web Dev.</p>
                    <p> I had always been intimidated by STEM, but had previous Academic experiences where two of my math professors encouraged me to pursue STEM in the future. While pursuing that degree, I found constant sources of guidance, feedback, and encouragement from my proffessors, classmates, and strangers, building a network of professionals that I know I can always go back to in search of wisdom.</p>
                    <p> Giving myself a chance at Software Engineering brought me to recognize the importance of implementing tech solutions to meet the needs of humanity. And it is because of such advancements in medicine, entertainment, communication, and more, so many people, my family, friends, and myself can live a better quality life.</p>
                    <p> I have seen how the arts have expanded my ability to problem solve and enhance my ability to think outside the box. However, my education in Software Engineering, combined with seven years of working in the IT industry, have equipped me with a more well-rounded perspective of where technology can still be improved. I want to make a positive difference in the Health, Telecommunication, and Entertainment industries. I look forward to improving the processes and technologies that make our world a better place one line of code at a time.</p>
