                    <!-- <p>I began my career in tech when I began working for AT&T, at the Mexican Headquarters, located in Naucalpan de Juarez, Estado de Mexico on October 2017. There, I was a bilingual Customer Service Executive dispatching, selling, and troubleshooting for different technologies provided by the company spanning from VoIP, Wireless, Networking, Cable, to general Mobile, Television, and Dish services. There, I was a high-performer that continously achieved a great relationship with the customer and company. I made several mistakes too, however these led me to eventually translate my skills into solving on-floor troubleshooting tasks like </p> -->

                   <!-- <p>
                    During my tenure as an Audio Engineer at BYU-Idaho's Audio Production, I embarked on a journey of certifications aimed at enhancing my engineering skills, particularly in managing audio signals and facilitating web-accessible broadcasted events. While the terms 'Audio' or 'Sound' might seem simplistic, my role exposed me to a diverse range of technologies, operating systems, IP fundamentals, and troubleshooting methodologies. My coursework in software and embedded technology provided valuable insights into tackling both common and unique challenges inherent in the role.
                   </p>
                   <p>One of the most enriching outcomes of this experience was my deepened understanding of the intricate network layers involved in disseminating critical data, spanning from binary to cloud levels within data centers.</p>
                   <p>My certifications, focused on Audinate and LAWO technologies, not only honed my expertise in these domains but also provided essential networking training and insights into signal flow fundamentals. These certifications paved the way for me to spearhead communication upgrade projects, where collaboration with telephony engineers, network engineers, and project managers was crucial for achieving desired outcomes within stipulated timelines.</p> 
                   <p>Certifications transcend specific areas of technology; they broaden your understanding of the world around you, much like any other learning opportunity.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, I completed the 'Secure Coding in Python' certification offered by LinkedIn, which imparted coding guidelines crucial for ensuring product safety and the secure handling of sensitive data, not only in Python but in programming in general. This certification, a requirement for my CSE 453 - Computer Security class, expanded my comprehension of how certain coding practices can render applications vulnerable under specific circumstances. Understanding, for instance, that assert objects, while useful in debugging, can potentially expose vulnerabilities in the final product was eye-opening. Embracing secure coding practices not only minimizes the risk of developing vulnerable applications but also enhances user experience.</p> -->
